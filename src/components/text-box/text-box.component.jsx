            Hello! My name is David. I enjoy reading, music, studying, making jokes, coding, skiing, rock climbing, kayaking,
            guiding, exploring, art, coffee, chocolate lava cake, helping people, discussing crazy topics, and trivia! I also like
            listing off things I like, and most recently have gotten VERY into computer science and web development. There are a couple 
            things I plan on adding to this site, but until then, feel free to navigate around or contact me if you have any further
            questions. I appreciate you checking it out!
