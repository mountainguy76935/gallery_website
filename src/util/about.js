I enjoy reading, music, studying, making jokes, skiing, rock climbing, kayaking, guiding, exploring, art, coffee, chocolate lava cake, helping people, discussing crazy topics, and trivia! I also like listing off things I like, and most recently have gotten VERY into computer science and web development. There are a couple things I plan on adding to this site, but until then, feel free to navigate around. I appreciate you checking it out!"
